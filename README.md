# Pyimagesearch-Crash-Course
This is everything I did during my Pyimagesearch Crash Course

**Note:** To get the simple neural network working, create a folder structure called **/kaggle_dogs_vs_cats/train**, download the training dataset [Kaggle-Dogs vs. Cats](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data) and put the images into the **train** folder (that folder had too many images to upload to GitHub).

**Note:** For the search bing api, create a dataset directory first using the **mkdir dataset** command so that all imnages downloaded with be stored there. After that, execute **mkdir dataset/"class_to_search"** to make a subdirectory and run the search for whatever class your searching for.
