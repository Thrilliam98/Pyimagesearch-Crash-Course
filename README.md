# Pyimagesearch-Crash-Course
This is everything I did during my Pyimagesearch Crash Course

**Note:** To get the simple neural network working, create a folder structure called **/kaggle_dogs_vs_cats/train**, download the training dataset [Kaggle-Dogs vs. Cats](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data) and put the images into the **train** folder (that folder had too many images to upload to GitHub).
